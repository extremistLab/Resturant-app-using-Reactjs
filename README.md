## Description:
The Restaurant App is a web application designed to facilitate online ordering from a restaurant. It allows users to browse the menu, add items to their cart, and place orders for pickup or delivery. The app provides a user-friendly interface for both customers and restaurant staff to manage orders efficiently.

## Features:
Step 1-> Menu Browsing: Users can browse the restaurant's menu to view available items and their descriptions.

Step 2-> Order Placement: Users can add items to their cart and place orders for pickup or delivery.

Step 3-> Cart Management: Users can view and modify the contents of their cart before finalizing their order.

## Technologies Used:
-> Frontend: React.js for building the user interface, including components for menu display, cart management, and order tracking.
